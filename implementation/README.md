# Reinforcement Learning with PPO and PPO++

This project implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an enhanced version (PPO++) for training agents in the Pendulum-v1 environment using PyTorch.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Gym
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

```
pip install torch gym matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Running the Code

To run the experiments, execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will train both the PPO and PPO++ agents and plot the results.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the implementation of the PPO and PPO++ algorithms, including the training loop and evaluation.
